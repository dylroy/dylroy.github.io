# Lecture 18: Wave Breaking

Shallow water wave height:

$$
\frac{H}{H_0}=(\frac{1}{2n}\frac{C_0}{C})^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

## Three types of breaking waves

1. Spilling Breakers
2. Plunging Breakers
3. Surging Breakers

### Spilling Breakers

Steep waves, high $\frac{H_0}{L_0}$

Shallow beach slope

Most energy lost to breaking, mostly lost to dissipative effect, very little energy is reflected

### Plunging Breakers

Shallow Waves, lower $\frac{H_0}{L_0}$

Steep beach slope

Most energy still lost to breaking, but some energy is reflected

### Surging Breakers

Long period waves

Very steep beach slope

Almost no energy lost to breaking, almost all energy is reflected

---

Off-shore wave steepness: $\frac{H_0}{L_0}$

Iribarren Number:

$$
\zeta_0 = \frac{\tan(\beta)}{\sqrt{\frac{H_0}{L_0}}}
$$

sometimes $\tan()$ will be dropped from numerator and just use $\beta$ because $\tan(\beta)\approx\beta$

In class exercise:

B has greater Iribarren number

Dissipative wave conditions (spilling breakers);  $\zeta_0<0.3$

Reflective wave conditions (surging breakers); $\zeta_0>1.25$

Intermediate wave conditions (plunging breakers); $0.3<=\zeta_0<=1.25$

## Shallow Water Waves

Stokes drift: net drift velocity in waves, *pumps water onto the beach* 

Shoaling zone:

Set-down theory, as waves enter the shallow water zone and start to grow in height, the average water level actually drops, then after break point the average water level increases

Setup: rise in water level due to waves

Swash: oscillation of water levels above and below setup

Runup: 

Infragravity energy:

In the surf zone, energy is transferred from high frequency waves to lower frequency oscillations as wave group velocities pile up wave velocities on the beach face

Wave setup:

$$
\eta_{setup}=0.35\beta_m(H_0L_0)^{1/2}
$$

Swash:

$$
S=[H_0L_0(0.563\beta_m^2+0.005)]^{1/2}
$$

Wave Run-up:

$$
\eta_{98}=\eta_{50}+1.1(\frac{S}{2})
$$

where $\eta_{98}$ = wave runup, $S$= swash excursion, $\eta_{50}$ = wave setup + tides + surge

$Z_t$ = elevation of dune toe, $Z_c$ = elevation of dune crest

Regimes of beach erosion:

Swash: ($\eta_{98} < Z_t$)

***Collision***: ($\eta_{98}>Z_t$)

Over wash: ($\eta_{98} > Z_c$)

Inundation: ($\eta_{50} > Z_c$)
