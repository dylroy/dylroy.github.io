## Storm Surge

Storm Surge: Difference between observed and expected tide during a storm

Storm Tide: Tidal height (above tidal datum) during a storm

Factors that determine flooding:

Wind Speed

Bathymetry

Tides

Waves

Pressure wind waves tides

$$
\Delta\eta_{total}=
\Delta\eta_{pressure}+
\Delta\eta_{wind}+
\Delta\eta_{waves}+
\Delta\eta_{tides}
$$

$$
\Delta\eta_{pressure}=\rho g \Delta h
$$

Coriolis parameter is to the right in the Northern hemisphere and to the left in the Southern hemisphere

Coriolis parameter goes to 0 at the equator while the Rossby number blows up to infinity

$$
\Delta\eta_{surge}=\frac{\rho_{air}C_dV^2_{wind}\Delta x}
{\rho_{water}gh}
$$
